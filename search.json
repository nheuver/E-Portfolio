    "text": "The capstone project for my Masters focused on creating synthetic imagery of fens using deep learning to increase the amount of training data for a landscape classification model. Fens are a relatively rare form of wetlands, and therefore training data is limited. Using the deep learning tools in ArcGIS, I was able to create synthetic images of fens that approximated the characteristics of real fen imagery.\n\nFigure 1. Real training images representing marshes (A, B, C) and synthetically created images representing fens (D, E, F) from the CycleGAN model. Using the CycleGAN deep learning framework in ArcGIS, style transfer was accomplished to create synthetic fen imagery from imagery of marshes.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
