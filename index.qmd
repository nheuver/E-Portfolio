I am a soon-to-be graduate of the Masters of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program at UBC, eager to begin my professional career. I have a passion for data analysis and coding, strong interpersonal skills, and I am looking for a job that allows growth, development and learning. With previous experience in biology and agriculture, I encompass diverse perspectives, a hardworking attitude and I am not afraid to get my hands dirty in the field.
