I am a soon-to-be graduate of the Masters of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program at the University of British Columbia, eager to begin my professional career. Through this program, I have gained extensive expertise in geomatics, including advanced proficiency in GIS platforms like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro, as well as coding in Python and R for spatial analysis. I am looking for a professional career that allows me to apply specialized expertise to real-world problems, and I am not afraid to expand my horizons beyond the fields I've experienced to date.

Before joining MGEM, I earned a Biology degree from the University of Victoria, focusing on ecology. My agricultural upbringing has also played a pivotal role in shaping my values and work ethic. My experiences, including applying precision agronomic techniques to farms in Saskatchewan through GIS tools, entomological research in Switzerland and agricultural work in Australia, have allowed me to connect technical skills with my passion for travel and the outdoors.Â
