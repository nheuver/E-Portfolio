I am a soon to be MGEM (Masters of Geomatics for Environmental Managment) grad at the University of British Columbia looking to start my professional career. Through this program I learned skills within the field of geomatics including extensive experience using GIS programs like QGIS and ArcGIS Pro, coding in python and r for spatial analysis. Before coming to MGEM, I studied Biology at the University of Victoria where I focused on ecology. I also come from an agriculture background which has been foundational to developing my hard-working attitude. Outside of school and work, I enjoy running, birding and traveling.
